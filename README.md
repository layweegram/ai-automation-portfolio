AI & Automation Projects

This repo is a collection of the automation workflows and tools I’m learning and building.
Most of them are built with n8n, APIs, and different AI models.
I use this space to test ideas, practice real integrations, and document what I can build.

What you’ll find here

Some examples of the things I work on:

small automations that connect APIs

n8n workflows for data extraction and notifications

experiments with search, embeddings, and rerankers

tests with self-hosted tools and open-source models

simple end-to-end automations I build for practice

Everything here is practical and based on real problems I try to solve.

Why I created this

I’m learning automation seriously and I want a place where I can:

track my progress

show real examples of what I can build

keep improving my skills

share clean workflow samples I can reuse later

Projects inside

I will keep adding more, but here’s what I’m starting with:

n8n workflow demos

API integration samples

small AI tests (RAG, reranking, etc.)

self-hosting experiments
